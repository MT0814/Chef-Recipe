## Project 2 - Chef Recipe Web Application

## Description

### Design Concept :

Everyone can be a Chef and save their yummy recipes in a place with a beautiful tiles presentation! Besides that, you may find more ideas here to create a New recipe!

### Why Chef Recipe?

Do you always have some pain-points like this?

- I cook everyday, I don’t even know what should I cook today?
- Why those recipes look so hard and complicated to follow up?
- Want to save my yummy recipes somewhere and go back to check if I forget.

### Our Plan is…

- Build an easy, simple, tasty recipe book for housewives and someone who needs to cook at home almost everyday like a Chef
- Provide a place to save those scrumptious, family recipes for those Chef Amateurs and share recipes with others.

### Design Process:

- Research : reference some market recipes websites, like allrecipes, simple recipes, food network, etc.
- Plan and Design : plan what we can do and design the layout (html/css)
- Build and Create : coding time!
- Test : we test and code together.
- Improve : there are still some unfinshed functions...

## User Story

```md
AS A user I WANT to see some yummy recipes with a brief description SO THAT I can have an idea about what I can cook today

As A user I WANT to see a recipe button on a recipe card SO THAT I can quickly click it to enter a whole recipe

AS A user I WANT to login recipe website SO THAT I can use some functions on the website
